# SymplecticOctics
Data for the verification of proofs of the paper *Algebraic and symplectic curves of degree 8*. It contains the following files:
- `ConstructionSymplecticGroup`. There are several auxiliary files in `files2`.
- `OcticInvolution`. Computation of the curves invariant by an involution.
- `CheckCurveInvolution`. Check the singularity types for the curve computed in the previous file.

  There is also a folder `functions` with auxiliary functions.
